The version is 1.7.

The 1.7 version of the project is distributed by Vivek Thampi with no LICENSE file, 
so for clarity, I gathered that information and put it into a LICENSE text file.

The original distribution of udis86 came with files for building on UNIX-like 
systems. I left those files out and built my own Visual Studio 2008 projects.
The source depends on a file config.h which is generated from the original build 
files based on the file config.h.in. I copied config.h.in to config.h and changed it
as needed.

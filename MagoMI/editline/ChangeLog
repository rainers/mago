WinEditLine's (formerly MinGWEditLine) ChangeLog
------------------------------------------------

*** April 12, 2014: release of WinEditLine 2.101 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - CMakeLists.txt was modified so that now both MinGW and MSVC
    compilers generate a DLL file with the same name (edit.dll);
    thanks to Peter Frentrup for suggesting this fix
  - Fixed a bug in readline(): when signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN) was used
    to ignore CTRL+C, WinEditLine crashed instead of returning NULL
    if CTRL+C was pressed at the beginning of the line (thanks to
    Peter Frentrup for reporting this)


*** January 13, 2014: release of WinEditLine 2.1 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Switched to CMake as build system
  - Now the library can be built with both MinGW compilers and
    Microsoft Visual Studio compilers; this is the reason why
    the library has been renamed from MinGWEditLine to WinEditLine
  - Added the rl_free() function to allow user programs freeing
    memory allocated in the library without causing a segmentation
    fault (see below)
  - For the same reason, the rl_user_completion_entry_free_function
    symbol has been added. This pointer, if set by the user, should
    point to a user-defined function which takes a void* argument
    and should simply call free() on the void* argument. This
    function is called by the library to free memory allocated by a
    user-defined custom completion function (if any)
  - Freeing memory by calling rl_free() and the user-defined function
    pointed by rl_user_completion_entry_free_function instead of
    free() is mandatory whenever a) the user program links to the
    DLL instead of the static library and b) the DLL links to a
    different runtime compared to the user program (e.g., this
    happens if the user program is built with GCC and links to
    a MSVC-built DLL, or viceversa). The same issue has also led to
    the implementation of the rl_free() function in GNU Readline
  - Added a few symbols which were not exported to the DLL
  - Handling of quotes in filename completion is much improved


*** June 20, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.07 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - A blank line is not introduced anymore at the bottom of the
    console window


*** June 19, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.06 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Improved redraw performance when dealing with large command
    lines
  - Fixed a potential buffer overflow issue in displaying long
    history lines
  - Fixed an issue which might arise in certain cases when using
    CTRL+W (delete-word)
  - Switched from autotools to standard makefiles for 32/64-bit
    platforms
  - Added test programs which can be built by "make test"
  - In addition to the static library now a DLL is also built
    (thanks to Tim Hudson at CryptSoft for the useful discussion)
  - Most common emacs key bindings are now supported (again, thanks
    to Tim Hudson for the suggestion)


*** June 13, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.04 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a number of issues which might arise using console windows
    with different screen buffer sizes
  - Fixed an issue connected with pasting UNIX-encoded clipboard
    contents


*** June 4, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.02 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added synchronization between wide-char and multibyte strings in
    _el_insert_char() and _el_delete_char() to avoid potential issues
    with custom completing functions or signal handling functions


*** June 2, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.01 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Support for rl_basic_word_break_characters[] and
    rl_completer_word_break_characters[] variables
  - Better handling of CTRL+C events (if the current line is not
    empty the function returns an empty string, otherwise CTRL+C is
    not intercepted)
  - MinGWEditLine does not crash anymore if a program omits calling
    using_history() before calling history-related functions
  - The prototype of readline() has been corrected to match
    GNU Readline's and EditLine's readline() prototypes
  - Minor bugfixes


*** May 21, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.0 ***

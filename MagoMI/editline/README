WinEditLine (formerly MinGWEditLine) is a BSD-licensed, open-source
software aimed at implementing most of the functionality of the GNU
Readline library in the framework of the native Windows Console.
In particular, the following functions have been implemented in the
WinEditLine API:

  void source_editrc()
  char *readline(char *prompt)
  char **rl_completion_matches(const char *text,
      char *entry_func(const char *, int))
  char *rl_filename_completion_function(const char *text, int state)
  void rl_free(void *mem)
  int using_history()
  void free_history()
  void free_history_entry(HIST_ENTRY *entry)
  void clear_history()
  char *add_history(char *line)
  HIST_ENTRY *remove_history(int i)
  HIST_ENTRY *replace_history_entry(int i, char *line,
      histdata_t dummy)
  HIST_ENTRY **history_list()
  int where_history()
  int history_length()
  HIST_ENTRY *current_history()
  HIST_ENTRY *history_get(int offset)
  int history_set_pos(int i)
  HIST_ENTRY *previous_history()
  HIST_ENTRY *next_history()
  int read_history(const char *filename)
  int write_history(const char *filename)
